# smesh.cloud

SmeshCloud is a hobbyist effort to enhance Spacemesh crypto. We create tools to help you maximize your Spacemesh experience.

## Introduction

If you haven't yet heard about [Spacemesh](https://spacemesh.io) you should stop everything you are doing right now and go read up. It is a revolutionary new crypto that does things a bit differently.

## Get Started

Here are some of the repositories for the projects we are contributing to the Spacemesh ecosystem:
* [smesher-plot-speed](https://github.com/smeshcloud/smesher-plot-speed) - Realtime statistics of your Spacemesh smesher PoST generation
* [multi-provider-generate-post](https://github.com/smeshcloud/multi-provider-generate-post) - Generate a PoST using multiple providers (i.e. multiple CPUs or multiple GPUs, on same or different systems)
* [auto-spacemesh](https://github.com/smeshcloud/auto-spacemesh) - An automated pipeline to generate PoST, PoET, and run a spacemesh node (utilitizes efforts from all of the other projects here)
* [nvidia-cuda-opencl](https://github.com/smeshcloud/nvidia-cuda-opencl) - Docker base image for easily harnessing NVIDIA-based CUDA & OpenCL, ideal for use with cloud providers for harnessing the [auto-spacemesh](https://github.com/smeshcloud/auto-spacemesh) pipeline
